Yaaaaaaaay :)
Hello there General Kenobi!
   It is just about arcseconds -- just like stars. 

 

   Since you know the focal length of the lens and can look up the pixel pitch of the sensor in the Nikon D90, you can figure out the image scale that camera and lens combinations produces. 

 

   Next, you calculate the angle subtended by the distant house using the same lens. When you compare the two, you will have the number of pixels the house covers for that camera / lens combination at the distance you were from the target.

 

Example:

    Nikon D90 Sensor Pixel Pitch = 5.5 um
    Lens Focal Length = 600 mm (You need to verify that the lens focal length is actually the same in the IR. Let's assume it is close.)
     
    Distance to House = 200 Km
    Width of House = 15 m
    Height of House = 8 m

 

   The image scale of the sensor is: arctan(PixelPitch / FocalLength) = arctan(0.0055 / 600) = 1.89 arcseconds/pixel

 

   The size of the house is arctan(HouseSize/Distance) = arctan(15 / 200,000) = 15.5 arcseconds

 

   Now if each pixel on the camera shows 2.1 arcseconds and the house subtends 15.47 arcseconds, then the image on the sensor will be 8.18 pixels across.

 

   (I hope I did those correctly... I had to redo it as I used a D60 instead of a D90 camera at first.)
